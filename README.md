# Titanic---Machine-learning-for-disaster
In this project I did kaggle competition project about to predict Titanic passenger survival

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my submission to the Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the training and testing datasets (train.csv, test.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
01_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb: Exploring the dataset and visualizing key features.
02_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
03_Model_Training.ipynb: Choosing and training machine learning models.
04_Model_Evaluation.ipynb: Evaluating model performance and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
src/: Python scripts for utility functions or reusable code.
output/: Contains the final model and submission file.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation set. More details about the model performance can be found in the 04_Model_Evaluation.ipynb notebook.
